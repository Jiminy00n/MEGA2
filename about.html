<h3>Key characteristics of the alt subculture</h3>

Online persona:
Alt individuals cultivate their identity across platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Tumblr, often expressing themselves through unconventional aesthetics, niche humor, and self-aware irony. Their online presence emphasizes authenticity, emotional openness, and rejection of mainstream social norms.

Aesthetic and fashion:
Alt fashion blends elements from punk, emo, grunge, goth, and Y2K revival styles. It commonly includes oversized band tees, fishnet layers, ripped jeans, chunky boots, plaid skirts, and bold accessories like safety pins or chains. The look intentionally contrasts polished beauty standards with raw individuality and rebellion.

<BR>
Makeup:
Alt makeup tends to be expressive and experimental. It may feature bold eyeliner shapes, dark or smudged eyeshadow, heavy mascara, and statement lip colors like black or deep burgundy. Some use graphic liner art or stickers to emphasize artistic self-expression over conventional beauty.
<BR>
Interests:
The alt community is tied to interests in alternative music (punk, emo, indie, hyperpop), visual art, digital subcultures, gaming, and internet humor. Members often engage with DIY art scenes, underground fashion, and online countercultural spaces.

Evolution of the term:
“Alt” originally described alternative subcultures outside the mainstream—especially in music and fashion—but has evolved to represent a broader online identity celebrating individuality, creativity, and anti-conformity. It now functions as both a style and a mindset that values authenticity over popularity.
